## Using React Native to create a mini design game (made for mobile using expo)

Proposal: Produce an application with a login and registration interface containing a mini game about basic mathematics. At the beginning you are asked for the difficulty level and at the end it contains a modal with the option to save and add your hits and a name to the Firebase "backend", which in the second tab shows the rank according to the chosen difficulty.

*Used: React Native with Expo and Firebase authentication, database*
